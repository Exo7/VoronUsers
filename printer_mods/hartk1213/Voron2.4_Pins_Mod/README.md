This mod is for the V2, it involves printing new AB drive frames, new XY Joints, new Front Tensioners, and new Z idlers

The pins have replaced m5 screws, at any location where the screw acts like a shaft, holding bearings, pulleys or idlers. This allows for smoother rotation and stops the possibility of motion parts being caught in threads. This work was done by everyone, thanks to ABS plastic and voron printers for the fast iteration, @doomweasel? they fall out yet?

To complete this mod the following files will need to be reprinted 

**A and B drive units**

 - a_drive_frame_lower_pinned.stl 
 - a_drive_frame_upper_pinned.stl 
 - b_drive_frame_lower_pinned.stl 
 - b_drive_frame_upper_pinned.stl

**Front Idlers**
- [a]_a_tensioner_pinned.stl
- [a]_b_tensioner_pinned.stl

**XY Joints**
- xy_joint_left_upper_pinned.stl
- xy_joint_left_lower_pinned.stl
- xy_joint_right_upper_pinned.stl
- xy_joint_right_lower_pinned.stl

**Z Idlers**
either one of these based on if you are using 6mm or 9mm belt
- [a]_z_tensioner_x4_6mm_pinned.stl
- [a]_z_tensioner_x4_9mm_pinned.stl

the following 5mm Pin hardware is what is needed as well 
these can be purchased from here 

Smooth pins

threaded pinse

```
[A-B] 
threaded @  30mm (x2)
smooth   @  28mm (x2)

[X-Y Joints]
smooth   @  40mm (x4)

[X-Y Idlers]
smooth   @  43mm (x2)

[Z Idlers]
smooth   @  28mm (x4)
```
NOTE: 2 smooth pins can be substituted for the threaded pins, the reason the threaded pins are there is for easy removal without the need to remove the stepper. but if you dont plan removing the pins without removing the stepper than smooth pins would work just fine for you in this situation.
